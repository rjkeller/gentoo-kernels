gentoo-kernels
==============

These are gentoo kernel .config files that I created to build kernels that work well for various things that I play around with. Some notes about these files:

1) They're designed for servers. So some of them may have missing GPU support.
2) They're designed to use systemd instead of openrc. If you want openrc, they will require modification.
